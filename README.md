Swift String Algorithms made in Playgrounds

##Reverse String
####You are to create a function that returns the string backwards. Ex:
* Input: "Potato"
* Output: "otatoP"

##PigLatin
You are to create a function that returns a string in PigLatin language. Rules:
* If a word begins with a __consonant__, move this consonant to the __end__ of the word and add __"ay"__ in the end. Ex: *"happy"* -> *"appyhay"*
* If a word begins with a __vowel__, add *"way"* in the __end__. Ex: *"another"* -> *"anotherway"*

##Palindrome Strings
You are to create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome.
Definition: "A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward."
* Input: "Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog" - "Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog"
* Output: true
* Input: "I like Swift" -> "tfiwS ekil I"
* Output: false

##Reverse Word
You are to create a function that returns the sentence backwards, reversing the words in the string. Ex:
* Input: "The Boy is ten years old"
* Output: "old years ten is Boy The"
