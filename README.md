Swift String Algorithms made in Playgrounds


##Easy
###Reverse String
You are to create a function that returns the string backwards. Ex:
* Input: "Potato"
* Output: "otatoP"

###Time Converter
Convert time from 12-hour to 24-hour format.
You are to create a funcion that returns a String with the 12-hour converted format
* Input: "08:25PM"
* Output: "20:25"
* Input: "06:42AM"
* Output: "06:42"

##Medium
###PigLatin
You are to create a function that returns a string in PigLatin language. Rules:
* If a word begins with a __consonant__, move this consonant to the __end__ of the word and add __"ay"__ in the end. Ex: *"happy"* -> *"appyhay"*
* If a word begins with a __vowel__, add *"way"* in the __end__. Ex: *"another"* -> *"anotherway"*

##Palindrome Strings
You are to create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome.
Definition: "A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward."
* Input: "Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog" - "Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog"
* Output: true
* Input: "I like Swift" -> "tfiwS ekil I"
* Output: false

##Reverse Word
You are to create a function that returns the sentence backwards, reversing the words in the string. Ex:
* Input: "The Boy is ten years old"
* Output: "old years ten is Boy The"
